---

### Category-Specific Trends

#### 📱 Electronics

- **Best Month:** May ($8,970 revenue)
- **Annual Performance:** Highest revenue generator ($69,089 total)
- **Concern:** Unexpected Q4 dip during traditionally high-growth holiday months
- **Investigation Needed:** Supply chain issues, competitive pressure, or pricing problems

#### 📚 Books

- **Highest Volatility:** Revenue swings from $5,118 (May) to $1,235 (July) - a 76% drop
- **Q3 Crisis:** Major dip throughout Q3
- **Q4 Recovery:** Highest AOV of the year (~$264 in December) despite revenue challenges

---

### Average Order Value by Category

### Critical Findings

#### ⚠️ Tier Convergence Problem

- Frequent periods where Bronze customers spend comparable to or more than Gold/Platinum customers
- **Examples:** May, August, October show minimal differentiation between tiers
- **Suggests:** Loyalty program is NOT effectively driving differentiated spending behavior

#### Seasonality Over Loyalty

- Q4 uptick and mid-year slump affect all tiers similarly
- **Insight:** Seasonality is a stronger driver than loyalty tier status
- Indicates tier benefits are not compelling enough to override seasonal shopping patterns

---

### AOV Patterns by Tier
(totable patterns)
#### 🥇 Gold Tier Paradox
- When Gold order volume spikes (February, May, August), AOV remains moderate or drops slightly
- Suggests Gold customers may have spending ceilings or budget constraints

#### 🥉 Bronze Tier Behavior
- Bronze customers buy frequently during promotions but don't significantly increase spending per transaction
- High volume, low value pattern indicates price-sensitive segment

#### 🥈 Silver Tier Consistency
- Most stable and highest-spending tier
- Reliable revenue stream with moderate volatility
